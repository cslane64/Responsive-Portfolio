                I am the Network Administrator for the Multistate Tax Commission. The 
                Multistate Tax Commission is an intergovernmental state tax agency 
                working on behalf of states and taxpayers to facilitate the equitable 
                and efficient administration of state tax laws that apply to multistate 
                and multinational enterprises. We have a geographically dispersed dispersed 
                work force of tax auditors and legal staff. Our headquarters office in Washington DC
                houses our data center as well as 15 support staff. Our audit staff conducts sales 
                and use as well as income tax audits on predominately Fortune 100 companies. Our legal
                staff provides amicus briefs to various state Supreme Courts as well as the Supreme
                Court of the United State. Some of the most noteworthy court decisions that our 
                legal staff has provided briefs for are Gillette v. California Franchise Tax Board
                and most recently South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. It is my job to ensure that all members
                of the staff have a computer that is working properly and that provides secure access
                to the Commissions data center. I am taking this class to learn how to make changes
                to applications that we are currently running and to create new applications as the 
                need for them arises.

                That covers my 'work' life, now onto my personal life. I joined the Navy directly out of
                high school. I spent 16 years in the submarine service. I have spent 94 consecutive days 
                under water. I have 2 daughters. One is 30 the other is 23. My oldest daughter has blessed
                me with three grand daughters. The oldest is 13 and the twins are 2. My youngest daughter
                just graduated from The College of William and Mary with a Masters in Business Analytics. 
                She works for one of the big 5 accounting firms and is based in Alexandria. I enjoy meeting
                her for lunch (which I always end up paying for) to discuss her upcoming wedding in October. 
                My hobbies are woodworking and cycling. I am looking forward to warmer weather so I 
                can get back on my bike. The type of cycing that I do is called <a href="https://rusa.org" target="_blank">randonneuring.</a> It is long distance, 
                unsupported cycling. The longest that I have cycled in one day is 134 miles. This seems like a lot 
                but it pales in comparison to the accomplishments of others that I ride with. Several members of our bike
                club have completed The <a href="http://www.raceacrossamerica.org/" target="_blank">Race Across America</a> and 
                last month one of the club members rode 405.82 miles in 24 hours at <a href="http://www.bikesebring.org/" target="_blank">24 hours of Sebring.</a>
